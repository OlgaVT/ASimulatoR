The goal of ass is to ...

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of ass from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("ass") -->
<!-- ``` -->

 You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "16946cf3c89e74cd07363d0f660559e4339d730b")
remotes::install_github("biomedbigdata/as_simulator")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ass, quietly = T)
## basic example code
```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- #summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

```{r visualization}
library(ggbio, quietly = T)
gff = rtracklayer::import('data/splicing_variants_ENSG00000122257.gff3')
exons = gff[gff$type == 'exon']
autoplot(split(exons, exons$transcript_id))
read.csv('data/event_annotation_ENSG00000122257.tsv')
```

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
